# Realtime Chat and video call WebApplication
Chat time is my webApp which is a real time chat and video calling web application which is very easy to use and accessible to everyone as I have put it on netlify now. I have used HTML/CSS,Javascript,ReactJS,WebRTC,Socket.io and NodeJS as my tech stack and it helped me to develop this application in which you can create a room and then talk with your group and can call your friend to a video call also with an eÞcient approach. In covid-19 period, it specially help students to work with their peers in group projects and oÞce people to discuss on a topic over texting or video call. In this app you can just create a room and join it with a username and your friends will be also joining it and then you will get your chat start then you can chat with texts and emojis and if you want then you can make a video call with just setting your username and one security code will be generated, share it with your friend or colleague then he will just paste the security code and his username and can call you in no time.
